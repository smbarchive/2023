title: "When should we explicitly model the dimerization of a transcription factor with many states? NsrR as a case study"
abstract: "Creating models in which a protein has multiple states due to the
binding of effectors or covalent modification is challenging. These
challenges are multiplied when the protein dimerizes due to the
combinatorial increase in the number of states of the assembly. In
bacteria, NsrR controls the expression of genes associated with
nitrogen oxide metabolism. The NsrR holoprotein holds an iron-sulfur
cluster that reacts with nitric oxide (NO) in multiple steps, and
typically acts as a repressor. The various nitrosylation states
of NsrR are functionally important because binding to different
gene promoters is differentially sensitive to the nitrosylation
state of NsrR's iron-sulfur cluster. Moreover, the active form of
NsrR is a dimer, leading to the combinatorial complexity mentioned
above. Based on a model for the control of Hmp, an NO dioxygenase,
by NsrR in emph{Streptomyces coelicolor}, conditions under which
it may be possible to ignore the dimeric nature of a transcription
factor or, conversely, conditions under which it would be prudent to
consider transcription factor dimers explicitly, are studied."
