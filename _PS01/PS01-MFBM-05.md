title: "Reducing gene expression noise: The role of RNA stem-loops in translation regulation"
abstract: "Stochastic modelling is key to understanding the dynamics of intracellular events in
most biochemical systems, including gene-expression models. The stochasticity in the
levels of gene products, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, is referred to as
noise, which leads to cell-to-cell variability. The contributions to noise can emerge from
different sources, such as structural elements. Recent studies have demonstrated that
mRNA structure can be more complex than the most straightforward assumptions.
Here, we study a structuration/generalisation of a stochastic gene-expression model in
which mRNA molecules can be found in one of its finite number of different states and
can transition among these states. In addition to characterising and deriving non-trivial
analytical expressions for the steady-state protein distribution, we provide two different
examples, which can be readily obtained from the structured/generalised model. The
main example pertains to the formation of stem-loops; here, we reinterpret previous
data and provide additional insights. Our analysis reveals that stem loops that restrict
translation can reduce noise."
