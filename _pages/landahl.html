									Over the years, The Society has provided the editor of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology with discretionary funds for secretarial and office expenses. When Herbert Landahl was editor-in-chief of the Bulletin, his wife, Evelyn, served as his secretary. Instead of taking a salary, she donated the funds ($35,000) to the Society in 1981. A decision was made by the elected Board of Directors to recognize the funds as a separate endowment and use the interest generated by the funds to provide travel support to graduate students and early career scientists to attend the Annual Meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology, thus called the Landahl Travel Award. </br>
