title: "Travelling wave of inhomogeneous DNA system"
abstract: "The sine-Gordon model was modified to depict the dynamics of the double helix of a DNA system. The model was based on an the inhomogeneities that exist in the base sequence of the DNA structure. Various works that has been done in similar areas were discussed as well as the method that was used . Computer simulations were performed on the model to see the distortions that occurs in the DNA system"
