title: "Data-driven, modeling, and topological techniques in cell and developmental biology"
organizers: "Alexandria Volkening, Andreas Buttenschoen, Veronica Ciocanel"
description: "Cell and developmental biology spans many interconnected temporal and spatial scales, including carefully orchestrated genetic regulatory networks and other intracellular dynamics, interactions between pairs of cells, and the collective behavior of thousands of cells during tissue formation or disease-related tissue disruption. Whether focused on questions such as how cells make decisions about their fate, respond to external signals, regulate their shape, migrate, or communicate with one another, the mathematical methods that researchers develop to address these questions are similarly broad and interconnected. Motivated by these observations, our minisymposium brings together scientists addressing a wide range of biological questions using data-driven approaches, mathematical modeling, or topological techniques. Our goal is to showcase mathematically complementary approaches and highlight interconnected questions in cell and developmental biology."

abstract1: "Cells communicate with one another through a variety of signaling mechanisms. The exchange of information via these mechanisms allows cells to coordinate their behavior and respond to environmental stress and other stimuli. To facilitate quantitative understanding of complex spatiotemporal signaling activity, we developed Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH), a general framework that encapsulates time-lapse signals on a cell adjacency graph in a low-dimensional trajectory. GSTH captures the signal at multiple spatial scales and over time by applying manifold-geometry preserving dimensionality reduction to geometric scattering features obtained from a cascade of graph wavelet filters.

We tested this framework using computational models of collective oscillations and calcium signaling in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, as well as experimental data, including in vitro ERK signaling in human mammary epithelial cells and in vivo calcium signaling from the mouse epidermis and visual cortex. We found that the geometry and topology of the trajectory are related to the degree of synchrony (over space and time), intensity, speed, and quasi-periodicity of the signaling pattern. We recovered model parameters and experimental conditions by training neural networks on trajectory data, showing that our approach preserves information that characterizes various cell types, tissues, and drug treatments. We envisage the applicability of our framework in various biological contexts to generate new insights into cell communication."

abstract2: "Biological systems are traditionally studied as isolated processes (e.g. regulatory pathways, motor protein dynamics, transport of organelles, etc.). Although more recent approaches have been developed to study whole cell dynamics, integrating knowledge across biological levels remains largely unexplored. In experimental processes, we assume that the state of the system is unknown until we sample it. Many scales are necessary to quantify the dynamics of different processes. These may include a magnitude of measurements, multiple detection intensities, or variation in the magnitude of observations. The interconnection between scales, where events happening at one scale are directly influencing events occurring at other scales, can be accomplished using mathematical tools for integration to connect and predict complex biological outcomes. In this work we focus on building statistical inference methods to study the complexity of the cytoskeleton from one scale to another by relying on two main components facilitating intracellular transport; that is microtubule network organization and cargo transport."

title3: "From microscopy to the distribution of mechanochemical efforts across a pair of cells"
additional_authors3: "Selena Gupta, New York University; Yelena Bernadskaya, New York University; Alex Mogilner, Courant Institute, New York University"
abstract3: "In a model organism, we use a combination of mathematical and experimental tools to tease apart the distribution of forces in a pair of cells responsible for forming the heart (and the pharynx). The heart progenitors provide one of the simplest examples of collective cell migration whereby just two cells migrate with a defined leader-trailer “assignment” between two tissues. The cells are also capable of moving individually, albeit by a shorter distance, with imperfect directionality, and with altered morphology. Thus, maintaining contact and the leader-trailer roles is important for directed migration to the destination. However, it is unclear why a two-cell system is better at migration than an individual cell. Based on in-vivo fluorescence imaging of the embryo, we obtain morphological measurements of the cells. Borrowing on the formulation of active droplet theory, we extract intracellular pressure and forces at the intersection of interfaces (e.g. cell-cell, cell-surface, cell-environment). These extracted measurements are then tested in the active droplet pair framework, and we observe that the 2-cell system does migrate and migrate persistently due to the difference in contact angle at the leading of the leader cell and the trailing edge of the rear cell."

abstract4: "Confocal microscopy imaging provides both positional information and expression levels from in vitro cell cultures; however, few methods exist to quantify the spatial organization of such cultures. Current quantitative tools generally rely on human annotation, require the a priori selection of parameters, or potentially lack biological interpretability. To address these limitations, we develop a modular, general-purpose pipeline that uses topological data analysis to extract structural summaries from cellular patterns at multiple scales. We apply our pipeline to study the pattern formation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) cultures, which have become powerful, patient-specific test beds for investigating the early stages of embryonic development. Our analysis captures both subtle differences in the spatial organization of hiPSCs based on different biological markers and progressive changes in patterning across incremental modifications of certain experimental conditions. These results imply the existence of directed cellular movement and morphogen-mediated, neighbor-to-neighbor signaling in the context of hiPSC differentiation."
