title: "Allee effects introduced by density dependent pheology"
abstract: "We consider a hybrid model of an annual species with the timing of a stage transition governed
by density dependent phenology. We show that the model can produce a strong Allee effect as well as
overcompensation. The density dependent probability function that describes how population emergence
is spread over time plays an important role in determining population dynamics. Our extensive numerical
simulations with a density dependent gamma distribution indicate very rich population dynamics, from
stable/unstable equilibria, limit cycles, to chaos."
