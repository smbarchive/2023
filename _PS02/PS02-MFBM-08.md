title: "Fixation dynamics for switching networks"
abstract: "Population structure has been known to substantially affect evolutionary dynamics. Networks that promote the spreading of fitter mutants are called amplifiers of natural selection, and those that suppress the spreading of fitter mutants are called suppressors. Research in the past two decades has found various families of amplifiers while suppressors still remain somewhat elusive. It has also been discovered that most networks are amplifiers under the birth-death
updating combined with uniform initialization, which is a standard condition assumed widely in the literature. In the present study, we extend the birth-death processes to temporal (i.e.,time-varying) networks. For the sake of tractability, we restrict ourselves to switching temporal networks, in which the network structure alternates between two static networks at constant time intervals. We show that, in a majority of cases, switching networks are less amplifying
than both of the two static networks constituting the switching networks. Furthermore, most small switching networks are suppressors, which contrasts to the case of static networks.
