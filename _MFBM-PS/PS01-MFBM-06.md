title: "Mood Prediction for Bipolar Disorder Patient with Sleep Pattern Information"
abstract: "Mood episode prediction is an essential task for the treatment of bipolar disorder patients. Recent studies revealed that sleep patterns and circadian rhythm misalignment are valuable information to predict mood episodes. However, the specific contributions of different sleep and circadian rhythm information to mood prediction are less understood. Here, we employed the XGBoost model and compare the importance of sleep and circadian rhythm features in predicting mood episodes. Additionally, we used SHAP value analysis to show the circadian rhythm and mood relationship difference between depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes."
