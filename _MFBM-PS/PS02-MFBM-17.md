title: "Data Driven Modeling of Biological Systems with Deep Neural Networks"
abstract: "We will present methods to uncover the unknown dynamics and features of several biological systems via deep neural network (DNN). We will show how DNNs can be used as approximations to flow maps of the true underlying biological system utilizing residual networks. Further, we will demonstrate its extension to systems with only partially observed data and systems with uncertain parameters. Once an accurate DNN model is constructed, it can be used as a predictive model for the unknown system, allowing us to conduct further system analysis. We will further explore its extension to the inverse problem, or recovering parameters on the system given the available data."
