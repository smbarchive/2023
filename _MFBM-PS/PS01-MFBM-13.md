title: "Noisy delay denoises biochemical oscillators"
abstract: "Genetic oscillators arise from delayed transcriptional negative feedback loops, wherein repressor proteins inhibit their own synthesis after a temporal production delay. This delay, generated by sequential processes involved in gene expressions such as transcription, translation, folding, and translocation, is distributed due to the inherent noise of the processes. Because the delay determines repression timing and therefore the oscillation period, it has been commonly believed that delay noise weakens oscillatory dynamics. However, in this talk, we demonstrate that noisy delay can actually denoise genetic oscillators by improving the temporal peak reliability."
