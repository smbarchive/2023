title: "Predator--prey dynamics with nonuniform diffusion with spatial heterogeneity"
abstract: "The evolution of biological species can emerge from the various phenomenon, such as various type of diffusion and the interaction between individuals.
Nonuniform diffusion is one of phenomenon that can be identified as part of evolution of a species.
This work focuses on the effect of nonuniform diffusion on a predator--prey population dynamic with spatial heterogeneity.
We consider a predator--prey model with nonuniform dispersal, representing the one species motility depending on the size of the others density in a spatially heterogeneous region.
We present results about local stability of two different semitrivial steady state solutions to the model where only one species survives, and the other species is absent between two species is investigated.
Additionally, we investigate the existence and non-existence of coexistence states."
