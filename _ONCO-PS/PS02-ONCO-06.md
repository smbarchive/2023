title: "Predictive nonlinear modeling of malignant myelopoiesis and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy"
abstract: "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood cancer characterized by dysregulated production of maturing
myeloid cells driven by the product of the Philadelphia chromosome, the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have proved effective in treating CML but there is still a cohort of
patients who do not respond to TKI therapy even in the absence of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase
domain that mediate drug resistance. To discover novel strategies to improve TKI therapy in CML, we
developed a nonlinear mathematical model of CML hematopoiesis that incorporates feedback control and
lineage branching. Cell-cell interactions were constrained using an automated model selection method
together with previous observations and new in vivo data from a chimeric BCR-ABL1 transgenic mouse
model of CML. The resulting quantitative model captures the dynamics of normal and CML cells at
various stages of the disease, exhibits variable responses to TKI treatment, predicts key factors of
refractory response to TKI treatment, and predicts potential combination therapy efficacy. Recent
experiments reveal that interactions and competition between different cellular compartments and
between normal and BCR-ABL1-expressing cells form a threshold that determines whether the malignant
cells can expand and cause leukemia. To capture these experimental dynamics, we found it necessary to
incorporate additional biological factors through the introduction of new cell types and interactions. We
applied an adapted model selection scheme to explore the unknown cell-cell interaction space and find
subsets of models consistent with experimental dynamics. We analyzed common motifs across
experimentally consistent models and identified interactions as targets for experimental design to further
narrow the valid models."
